            <h1>What is Poverty?</h1>
            <p>Poverty is about not having enough money to meet basic needs including food, clothing and shelter.  However, poverty is more, much more than just not having enough money </p>
            <p>The World Bank Organization describes poverty in this way:</p>
            <blockquote cite="https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/esic/overview/content/what_is_poverty.html">
               <p>"Poverty is hunger. Poverty is lack of shelter. Poverty is being sick and not being able to see a doctor. Poverty is not having access to school and not knowing how to read. Poverty is not having a job, is fear for the future, living one day at a time."
            </blockquote>
            <p>In addition to a lack of money, poverty is about not being able to participate in recreational activities; not being able to send children on a day trip with their schoolmates or to a birthday party; not being able to pay for medications for an illness.  These are all costs of being poor.  </p>

            <h1>ABOUT US </h1>
            <p>When you think about poverty, what comes to mind? It's probably an image of a person who doesn't have enough food to eat, lives in a shabby home or no home at all. And they probably can't afford to buy the goods and services you normally take for granted. You're not wrong, but the complexity of poverty may surprise you.
            </p>
            <p>This Website aims to enlighten the audience on what is happening on the world today. May we reflect on the lives of those who are suffering and be mindful of our actions and someday be a helping hand to our brothers and sisters.</p>
